# CryptoMonitor
Scrapes 4chan's business board for mentions of Cryptocurrencies, then writes data to an Excel file

CryptoFind.py and CoinDict.py are nescessary files, CryptoFind Calls Coin Dict to determine Crypto currency names. The Excel file it writes to is called tester.xlsx

ReadtoRFile is an optional bit of code that reads from the Excel file into R code to make it easy to examine the data with R.


# Graphing
Done using plotly. Json is converted to dataframes using pandas
